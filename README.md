The following directory contains solutions to programming contest problems
taken from [Steven](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/ ) and
[Felix](http://felix-halim.net/) Halim's wonderful textbook,
[Competitive Programming 3](https://www.lulu.com/shop/view-cart.ep). 

The actual problems are taken from [the UVa Online](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/) Judge, but 
the text does a great job of categorizing problems by problem type so that 
programmers can get more targeted practice. 

For example,if one wants extra practice solving problems that require the application of a Greedy Algorithm, 
she can find a cornucopia of problems listed in their text that utilize said
Algorithm.
